I do like Ubuntu Netbook Remix’s UI. However with 10.04 it’s just gone
so unstable for me.

-  After login when system prompts for keyring secret, UNR environment
   crashes and drops to gnome. I have to relogin if I need UNR env.
-  After I removed a few packages it could not just start gnome panel
   causing a great inconvenience. I guess this is due to Evolution
   integration with latest Ubuntu. Mail client I like and use is
   `Thunderbird`_. I cant switch to Evolution.
-  Initially after 10.04 release it was damn slow to respond, so had to
   do some work around to get it to acceptable speed.

Considering all that I decided to switch to `Xfce`_. It just worked like
charm. But now I also use (and like :) ) `UbuntuOne`_ service for my
backup. UbuntuOne is not integrated for XFCE. Also you cant do
everything from UbuntuOne’s cli.

::

    u1sdtool -q; killall ubuntuone-login; u1sdtool -c # configuration
    u1sdtool --create-folder ~/my_data # add folders you want to be synced
    u1sdtool --list-folders
    u1sdtool --current-transfers
