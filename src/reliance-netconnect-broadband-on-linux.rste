-  It works. Make sure while purchasing you inform them that you use Linux
-  Itâ€™s fast and reliable in Pashan, Pune area
-  Below config worked for me on Ubuntu 9.10 AND 10.04
-  There are Linux drivers on the CD but I could not get it working on Ubuntu 9.10.
-  For activation, I had to use Windows :(
