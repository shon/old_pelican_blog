Surely one of the most over-hyped film. What was good? Aamir, Music and
the first half laughs. Post interval it becomes a predictable, boring,
idiot bollywood movie.

Munnabhai s were certainly better. I would say watch it on TV or atleast
donâ€™t pay 3 times higher than usual for tickets like we did. 4 and half
stars by critic hmmmm..
